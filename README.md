# zsh-theme-minimal

A minimal zsh theme, that uses the least features I need to be productive.

Created because [zsh-theme-enormous] was becoming too slow.

## Install (with oh-my-zsh)

1. Download `minimal.zsh-theme`.
2. Put it in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/`.
3. Edit `~/.zshrc` with `ZSH_THEME="minimal"`.
